1. What is an Algorithm?
Step by step method of solving a problem
A sequence of finite steps to solve a problem
Independent of a programming language

2. Time and Space Complexity Overview
We decide which algorithm is best by analysing their time and space complexity.
Time Complexity - Time taken by an algorithm to execute a program.
Space Complexity - Extra space required by an algorithm

Constant TC- when the execution of a program does not depend on the input.

3. Asymptotic Notations
There are 3 asymptotic notations - big O, theta and omega

Lets discuss each of them
Big Oh Notation- It indicates the maximum time required by an algorithm for all input. (WC)
Big Omega - It indicates the Minimum time taken by an algorithm. (BC)
Big Theta - It indicates the average time taken by ana algorithm 

4. Time Complexity - Iteration
In this case we calculate the Time complexity by calculating the number of operations or the number of times the loops will run

5. Time Complexity - Recursive
In this case we cannot calculate the number of operations. Thus we need to find the recurrence relation to get the Time Complexity.
