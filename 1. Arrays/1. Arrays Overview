    The same data type stored in contiguous memory location.

Q. Declaration of an Array
    Int[] a or int a[] 

Q. Create an Array of integers
    Int[] a = new int[100];

Q. Initialise an Array
    Int[] a = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
    This will create an array of size 7. Size of array once declared cannot be changed.
